        <p style="color:white;margin-left:10.5em">Our Dracula site is a analytical breakdown of the story of Dracula. This site is the final project for 7 students for DIGIT 110 at Penn State Behrend. Using many different text analysis techniques our group decided to focus on the locations and technology discussed in Dracula.</p>

       <p style="color:white;margin-left:10.5em">During the course of this project, we have learned that Dracula, by Bram Stoker is written in a way that trick the mind to thinking its real. From the historical location embedded in the text to the way each chapter is written like pages from peoples' diarys. The auther Bram Stoker used real locations as a basic for his storys as a way to make the story seem real. Before, writing Dracula, Stoker spent years reacherching European fokelore and stories of vampires. This knowlege make Dracula more bellievable. Another noticable thing in the book is the use of charecter description. Stoker help paint a picture of what charecters like Dracula and Van Helsing look like, all while keeping the allusion of journal entries.   </p>
