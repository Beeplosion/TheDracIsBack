        <h2 style="color:white;padding-left:.5em">About</h2>
        <p style="color:white;text-align:center">This project aims to analyze and represent Bram Stokers Dracula. It focuses on different historical locations,  different historical locations, important characters, and mention of tecnology in the book. During the course of the project we had analysed the text, broke our anaysisation down by chapters, and desplayed the locations, characters, and tecnollogy we found in the book. If we were to continue with the project. We wuld look for cultural implications, references to medical practices or history, and how the location describe in the book related to actual locations and places during the time period the book takes place. </p>

        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: Sebastion was the head of making our Github repository and worked closely with the Professor with any issues. The team split the Github into 3 files, project work, outdated work and docs. The docs holds all of the html files, outdated holds old files and project work is all of the relevant files to the project.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color:cadetblue;margin-left:2em"><a href="https://github.com/Beeplosion/TheDracIsBack/blob/main/project-work/Dracula.xml" style="color:#55d6aa"> XML Link</a> </h3>
        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: Sam, Destinee and Ruby all worked together on the xml to break down what they wanted to pull from the Dracula text. The team decided that they would focus on 1. Different historical locations and Technology of the Victorian Era. Using this Sam was able to connect which charcters used which technolgy in the text. The team also pulled out all the interesting things from the XML code into a organized graph on the Analysis page where you can view where things appear in the text.  </p>
        
        <h3 style="color:cadetblue;margin-left:2em"><a href="https://github.com/Beeplosion/TheDracIsBack/tree/main/docs" style="color:#55d6aa"> HTML Link</a> </h3>
        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: For the HTML Destinee took on the majority of the work creating the base site. She followed a tutorial online and then built upon it to create a base for the Dracula site. Then from there she added animations to the navigation bar and other things to make the site more interactive. After that it was uploaded to the github so everyone could work on it. After that multiple group members took on different tasks to bring the site together. Destinee and Sam worked together to put the XSLT outputs onto the site and make it visually appealing. Finally the team worked together on the final touches for the site. </p>

        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: We set up rules that confined the text options inside elements such as date and char. We did this to make sure the information inside those key elements stayed consistent with the original text, as it would trigger an error if it were to be changed.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color:cadetblue;margin-left:2em"><a href="https://github.com/Beeplosion/TheDracIsBack/blob/main/project-work/XSLT_V3.htm" style="color:#55d6aa"> XSLT Link</a> </h3>
        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: The goal with the XSLT was to be able to show all the different technologies, locations and characters within a specific chapter. We did this by first creating an xml sheet that was marked up with all the different fields we were looking for. We then used XSLT to create an interactive analysis page that included a table that shows first each chapter, and then the corresponding attributes of interest from within that chapter.  Each chapter than links to its corresponding chapter on the text page. The text page consists of the entire text of the book Dracula. Each mention of a technology, character or location is highlighted and underlined for better visibility. This was done like this to better help someone understand the world and culture that Dracula took place in.</p>

        <p style="color:white;margin-left:2.5em">About: The goal of the Network analysis was to be able to visualize who might have been associated with what tech. This is done with some XSLT coding that pulls out charecters and tech that are mentioned within the same paragraph. Special super huge mega thanks to DR.B for this, with very minute help from Sam.</p>
